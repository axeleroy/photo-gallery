# PhotoGallery

A minimal photo gallery intended to use with static websites.

## Goals and functionalities
When working on this project, my goals were to make this photo gallery
* Embeddable in a static website.
* Functionaly minimal: it should just display albums and pictures with relevant EXIF data.
* (relatively) Lightweight with minimal dependancies, with notably no CSS framework involved.
* Fast performance, with small thumbnails and HTTP requests caching.

### What are not goals of this project
* Being user friendly. There's no GUI to manage albums and pictures.
* Handle everyone's use-cases. My main goal was to make a custom solution for my own portfolio,
not to anwser a broad userbase's needs.
