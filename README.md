# PhotoGallery

## Todo

* Picture page
    * Extract and display EXIF data (see https://www.npmjs.com/package/exif-js)
        * Try passing it the `img`'s URL instead of the element (it does not seem to work)
        * Try getting the element in pure JS
    * Navigating between images and back to album using arrow keys and ESC
    * Zooming in image
* Styling / icons
